    <h2 class="g">What is Augmented Reality?</h2>
    <p class='me'>
      Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of
      digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among
      companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in particular. Ar has a very rich <a
        href="#hist"> History.</a>
      <br>Amid the rise of data collection and analysis, one of augmented reality’s primary goals is to highlight
      specific features of the physical world, increase understanding of those features, and derive smart and accessible
      insight that can be applied to real-world applications. Such big data can help inform companies' decision-making
      and gain insight into consumer spending habits, among others.
      <br>A view of the physical real-world environment with superimposed computer-generated images, thus changing the
      perception of reality, is the AR.
      The term itself was coined back in 1990, and one of the first commercial uses were in television and military.
      With the rise of the Internet and smartphones, AR rolled out its second wave and nowadays is mostly related to the
      interactive concept. 3D models are directly projected onto physical things or fused together in real-time, various
      augmented reality apps impact our habits, social life, and the entertainment industry.
      <br><br>AR apps typically connect digital animation to a special ‘marker’, or with the help of GPS in phones
      pinpoint the location. Augmentation is happening in real time and within the context of the environment, for
      example, overlaying scores to a live feed sport events.
      Augmented reality continues to develop and become more pervasive among a wide range of applications. Since its
      conception, marketers and technology firms have had to battle the perception that augmented reality is little more
      than a marketing tool. However, there is evidence that consumers are beginning to derive tangible benefits from
      this functionality and expect it as part of their purchasing process.
      <br>Elsewhere, augmented reality’s benefits could extend to the health care sector, where it could play a much
      bigger role. One way would be through apps that enable users to see highly detailed, 3-D images of different body
      systems when they hover their mobile device over a target image. For example, augmented reality could be a
      powerful learning tool for medical professionals throughout their training.
      Some pundits have long-speculated that wearable devices could be a breakthrough for augmented reality. Whereas
      smartphones and tablets show a tiny portion of the user’s landscape, smart eye-wear, for example, may provide a
      more complete nexus between real and virtual realms if it develops enough to become mainstream.

    <p class='me'><b>AR in the 1980s.</b> In 1980 Steve Mann developed a first portable computer called EyeTap, designed
      to be worn in front of the eye. It recorded the scene to superimposed effects on it later, and show it all to a
      user who could also play with it via head movements. In 1987 Douglas George and Robert Morris developed the
      prototype of a heads-up display (HUD). It displayed astronomical data over the real sky.<br> <b>AR in the
        1990s.</b> The year 1990 marked the birth of the “augmented reality” term. It first appeared in the work of
      Thomas Caudell and David Mizell – Boeing company researchers. In 1992 Louis Rosenberg of the US Air Force created
      the AR system called “Virtual Fixtures”. In 1999, a group of scientists led by Frank Delgado and Mike Abernathy
      tested new navigation software, which generated runways and streets data from a helicopter video.<br> <b>AR in the
        2000s.</b> In 2000 a Japanese scientist Hirokazu Kato developed and published ARToolKit – an open-source SDK.
      Later it was adjusted to work with Adobe. In 2004 Trimble Navigation presented an outdoor helmet-mounted AR
      system. In 2008 Wikitude made the AR Travel Guide for Android mobile devices.<br> <b>AR today</b>. In 2013 Google
      beta tested the Google Glass – with internet connection via Bluetooth. In 2015 Microsoft presented two brand new
      technologies: Windows Holographic and HoloLens (an AR goggles with lots of sensors to display HD holograms). In
      2016 Niantic launched <b>Pokemon Go</b> game for mobile devices. The app blew the gaming industry up and earned $2
      million in a just first week. </p>
